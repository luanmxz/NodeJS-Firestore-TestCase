# NodeJS-Firestore-TestCase

## About
This project serves as an introductory exploration of using Firestore with Node.js. It aims to provide a basic understanding of integrating Firestore, a flexible and scalable database for mobile, web, and server development, into a Node.js application.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A Google Cloud account with Firestore enabled
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/luanmxz/NodeJS-Firestore-TestCase.git
    cd NodeJS-Firestore-TestCase
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. **Set up Firestore:**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create a new project (if you don't have one).
    - Navigate to Firestore Database and create a new database.
    - Obtain your Firebase configuration file (`.json`) and place it in the project root directory.

2. **Configure the application:**
    - Ensure the Firebase configuration details are correctly set in your application.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Node.js application and connect to your Firestore database.

2. **Interacting with Firestore:**
    - The application includes basic CRUD operations to interact with the Firestore database. Refer to the code in the `app` directory for examples.
